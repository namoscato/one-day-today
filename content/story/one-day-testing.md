#### What is your educational background?

I graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) with a Bachelors of Science in Art Education in 2008. Though I originally enrolled as a Marketing major, I quickly switched majors after taking an Art History class. After teaching Art for a few years, I decided to really focus my passion for artistic practice, so I went to art school. Going to art school was a goal I had aspired to achieve since I was in High School. I moved to Savannah, GA, and graduated with a Master in Fine Arts in Painting from Savannah College of Art and Design in November 2015.
