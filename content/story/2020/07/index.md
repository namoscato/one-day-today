#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

Growing up, I always thought I wanted to work with children but wasn't convinced I would go into education. I come from a long line of educators, my great-grandfather, grandfather, as well as both of my parents all worked in schools. When I went to college, I was unsure if I truly wanted to follow in the footsteps of my family.  It took an international trip to Africa to show me that education had been my path all along.

When I was a Junior in college going into my senior year, I worked as an international intern in Nyeri Kenya where I worked in a destitute children's home. While working with the students and community, I was able to shadow a school counselor. I realized in that experience that my love for helping others and the enjoyment I got from working with kids could be found in the perfect career as a school counselor. After I graduated from college I went straight into graduate school to get my masters in school counseling. My family jokes that even though my Dad ended his career as a middle school counselor, it took me flying half way across the world to realize that was my passion as well!

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I am currently working as an elementary counselor in an elementary school with students K-5. I previously worked at the middle level with students 6-8. I am relatively new to the education profession, but I find that each new experience allows me to learn new things about myself and furthers my passion to work with students.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

As I stated previously, I am new to the education field. Keeping the passion that I feel now for teaching and working with students as a new educator is something I think about a lot, and I want to aspire to do as I move throughout my career. Like any profession, the longer you do it the more you can grow to feel burned out. My hope is that I can continue to grow as I learn more and more about being an educator. My main goal in life, not only professionally, is to help others. I think continuing to educate myself in the world of school counseling will help me feed that desire to help others; as well as keep me in the education profession for many years to come.

#### One day what do you hope for?

My main hope for education is to allow everyone to realize that we have to teach the whole child. As a school counselor, mental health is something I identify as a key piece in a child's success. If we don't understand the outside factors that affect our studentâ€™s lives, we can never hope to understand how to help them academically. This was something I observed a lot growing up. There would be students in my class who I knew had so much stuff going on with them in the outside world, but our teachers never tried to understand why that specific student was acting the way they were.

I know this is not the case with all educators, I have seen first-hand teachers go above and beyond for their students every day. However, it is easy sometimes for us as adults to forget what it is like to be a kid and all the things that can distract you in a day. My hope is that as we continue to learn as educators, and we can continue to challenge ourselves to see the whole child. This is something I can forget to do myself, but I always want to push myself to work on looking at the entire picture and not just what I see of a student at first glance.
