#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

There are a few instrumental people in my life who have inspired me to become an educator.  First, and foremost, my mother.  My mom was a teacher, and she taught eleventh and twelfth grade English to students who were thrown out of the public school system because of violence, truancy, etc.  My mother had a gift for connecting with these students and making a difference in their lives.  She believed in them so much, they believed in themselves.  She saw qualities in them that others did not.  It was actually just a few months ago that she ran into one of her old students (my mom has since retired from the teaching profession,) and she beamed because this student remembered her and told her, "It was because of you that I got my life straight."  Teachers have this power to instill and empower others.

Others who have inspired me were kids!  As a teenager, I worked with students with disabilities and babysat.  Being around those kids helped me to see and learn a lot about myself.  I could easily connect with them, help them believe in their abilities, and see them for who they were: the gifts of our future.  I am forever thankful for those opportunities, life experiences, and people who were so instrumental in my life.  All of them lead me to the teaching career I have now, the teacher I am now, and the person I am and want to be.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

Currently, I am in my sixth year of teaching.  I was fortunate enough to be hired right out of college.  I have taught kindergarten for all six years.  I am also in my third year of being my school district's Early Childhood Transition Coordinator, where I help to build bridges between pre-k programs and our district, easing the transition.  I have a Master's Degree in Education (Reading Specialist and Literacy Coach).  Recently, I enrolled as a Post Bacc student at Point Park University.  I am earning my Principal Certification and finishing the first of three years of their doctoral program in Leadership and Administration this summer.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

I cannot imagine leaving the field of education.  I am still in the field and plan to always be in the field because I truly believe there is no more important job in the world than positively affecting our future.  Loving students, teaching them academic lessons, life lessons, and teaching them how to be reflective and believe in themselves is just everything good!  Also, when you teach elementary, especially kindergarten, there are a lot of smiles and laughs!  Teachers get to be change agents, mentors, moms, dads, counselors, and everything in between.  They get to be whatever their students need.

#### One day what do you hope for?

One day, I hope to be an elementary principal whose mission is to positively affect each and every student's life that I cross.  I hope to be a part of a vision that works with all neighboring districts to make positive changes in all students' lives.  Lastly, I hope that I am a person who is always there for my staff, community, and students, and a leader who leads with her heart.
