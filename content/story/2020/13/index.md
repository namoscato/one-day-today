#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

My fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Sopko, was the person that inspired me to be a teacher. What I remember the most about her class is the stories we used to read (I can still list a few) and how she would bring them to life. She dressed up and acted as a teacher from a book we read, and it really inspired a love for reading in my life. I think having this great experience started the idea of being a teacher. The relationships I had with other teachers later on really cultivated this interest.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

Currently, I am a K-3 special education educator teaching learning support in mostly a pull-out model. I have been a learning support teacher for grades K-6. While holding that job, I have held the following positions at different times: induction guide, special ed team lead, a mentor teacher, school assessment coordinator, student leadership group teacher lead, PBIS team member and team data participant.  If I have learned one important lesson  it is  that if you're asked to do one thing and do it well, three more roles will follow. Teachers truly do wear many hats throughout the day and throughout his/her career.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

Certainly there have been times I have contemplated leaving due to a number of factors. However, thinking about my students has always encouraged me to stay on the path. The students are the reason I go to work, put in extra hours and buy snacks and incentives. They are the “why” behind all of the things I don’t have to do, but I do anyway in order to make the day more magical.

#### One day what do you hope for?

I hope that one day our students will realize the impact that they have had on all of our lives. All students have the ability to impact the world in a truly special way.

More broadly, I wish that education would be more equal amongst districts, schools, classrooms. I do wish that school would stop popping up in the same areas as our public schools and thus take funding from public education. We all have the ability to do great things, but we could do even more with better funding. The school district I currently teach in is quite successful but has one of the smallest budgets, oldest technology, and smallest staff size. Imagine what we could do for students if more money could be spent on proper resources and more impactful curriculum.
