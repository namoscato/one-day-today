#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I have been a teacher of almost every English grade and English elective. I used to lead a Parent Academy at my school. I am a theatre director as well as a testing coordinator. I help in all school activities. Basically, I am used to  just wearing whatever “hat” is thrown my way in order to help the students. Mostly, I’m an unofficial therapist to most kids and a surrogate mom to many. My name has gone from “my real name” to “mom” for a lot of my students.

I have taught grades 7-12, but I currently teach 9-12.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

The thank-you messages I still receive every year from at least one student keep me going. It’s not always thanking me for something academic, but I feel that this does not matter. Making one small impact is something to be celebrated. I have a folder in my email that is titled “Reasons Why I’m Still Here”.

I will also share that when you teach for a certain number of years, you’re kind of stuck. Even if I did want to leave my job, it just isn’t the responsible thing to do. I have bills to pay and a family to take care of. I consider it a sacrifice for my kids. If it wasn’t a matter of responsibility, I might have left. Education is the one profession where no matter how hard you try, the social ills of society are always blamed on the educators, since no one wants to be honest and lay blame where it belongs.

#### One day what do you hope for?

One day, I hope that the pendulum swings the other way and teachers are just left to teach. I would love to see education become something that is valued and not mocked in communities like the one I teach in. I want politicians to stay out of education! Those who don’t work directly with children every day need to stop telling us that we aren’t doing our jobs. I would hope that they realize that by not being in the trenches, they don’t have the expertise. I would hope that children become more than just photo-ops for those in the “ivory tower”. Most importantly, I hope that there is a realization that test scores mean nothing. Truly, one’s self-worth, talents and abilities should not be dictated by test scores.
