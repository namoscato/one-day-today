#### What is your educational background?

M.Ed. in Instruction and Learning from the University of Pittsburgh. I am currently a Kindergarten and Learning Support teacher in Pittsburgh, PA.

#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

I was inspired to become an educator when I realized the impact that teachers had on my own family. Growing up, I witnessed my parents coming home defeated after conversations with teachers that left them feeling as though educators were not advocating or supporting their children. This left me feeling upset; angry that this was happening and not knowing exactly what I could do to help. On the other hand, I also saw them come home full of joy and hope, knowing that a teacher had their child's back and was ready to go to bat for them. I knew from a young age that I wanted to be that person for children and their families. I wanted to be the teacher that made children and families feel safe, supported, and loved.

This feeling stayed with me through elementary, middle, and high school. There were times when I thought I may want a different career, but the field of education always made its way back as my #1 choice. I went to college certain that I wanted to become a teacher. This feeling grew even stronger when I began the CASE Program at the University of Pittsburgh. I was suddenly surrounded by professors and a cohort that had the same dreams, goals, and ideas as me. I was able to hear about my cohort's experiences, philosophies, and educational beliefs. I became inspired by each and every one of them. This cohort had turned into my education family and each person left a mark on me and helped me grow as an educator. I participated in classes that discussed inequity, injustice, ideologies, and more. These courses were led by professors with a passion for education that was contagious and left me with the desire to keep learning and growing.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

Currently, I am a Kindergarten Teacher and Learning Specialist in Pittsburgh. I will begin my second year of teaching this August. Before that, I had incredible opportunities to student teach in Kindergarten, Life Skills, 2nd Grade, and Special Education classrooms, as well as substitute, teach at a Montessori school. I also spent a large period of time in ChildWatch at the Thelma Lovette YMCA working with children of all ages and taught preschool-aged children over the summers. Each opportunity that I have experienced has influenced who I am currently as an educator and has changed me for the better.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

When I read this question I immediately said out loud and to myself, "the children". I am still in the field of education because of the children. I feel lucky that I get the opportunity to wake up each day, hop on the bus, and enter a classroom with our future world-changers. These children make me laugh, they make me cry, they make me laugh until I cry, and everything in between.

We are not in school only to learn to read, write, and solve math problems. We are in school to learn how to make friends and to learn how to talk through disagreements. We go to school to create and to build. We go to school to PLAY! Children learn so much through social interaction and play. When we allow children to explore their surroundings, play with others, and ask questions, we are allowing them to take charge of their learning and hopefully in turn, spark joy in learning.

#### What changes can you make to shift the field towards equity and justice?

I feel fortunate to have worked at schools and in communities that continue to discuss injustice and inequality in education and continue to work towards a better educational system for the world and within their own walls. These conversations were especially prevalent when schools had to move to distance learning in March. Every student has a story and every child is coming from a different background. We need to work to understand the child's background, where they are coming from, and work to provide a quality education that each child deserves. I believe as educators, these conversations are not only important to have, but necessary.

Personally, I am continuing to educate myself and think deeply about my teaching practices. How am I making changes for the better? What have I done that has been potentially harmful and unjust? What am I actively going to do to change that? What do I need to do to provide an equitable and just learning environment for each of my children? Teachers are life-long learners -- the work is never done. I must constantly check myself, challenge myself, and reflect on my teaching. I want to continue to learn about and work against the systemic issues in the education system so each child can receive a quality education.

#### One day what do you hope for?

One day, I hope that each child feels safe, supported, and loved. I hope each child comes to school and can wonder, create, and feel seen as a vital member of a community. They are inventors, artists, and writers. Children are the future.
