#### What inspired you to become an educator?

My mom was an English teacher for 35 years, and I always enjoyed going into her classroom. However, as a kid, I loved music and always wanted to be a musician or music teacher. In high school, I was a big buddy and took child education at the preschool on campus and fell in love with teaching. I decided to follow my mother's footsteps and learn to become a teacher.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I began as a fourth grade permanent substitute teacher at my alma mater, South Fayette. Then, I was hired at Seneca Valley in kindergarten. It's my sixth year of teaching.

#### Why are you still in education?

I am a lifelong learner, and I'm pretty sure teaching is in my blood. :) Every year I learn about myself as a teacher, and try new things in the classroom based on my classes. Simply put, I'm in it for the kids.

#### One day what do you hope for?

I look forward to the future when my students go beyond school, and I hope that I can still stay in touch with some of them and see the positive things they grow up to do in the world. I will forever be proud to be their kindergarten teacher.
