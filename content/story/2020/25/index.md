#### What is your educational background?

I received a Bachelor of Music Education from West Virginia University and am currently pursuing a Master of Music Education from Boston University.

#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

I was inspired to become an educator during some teaching experiences I had in the Pittsburgh area that I gained while I was working towards my undergraduate degree. I actually went through a time early in college where I did not think I was cut out for the field of education and almost switched my major to Aerospace engineering. However, after working with students at a local school district I knew I needed to be a music teacher.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I am the Elementary Band Director in the Avonworth School District. Also, in Avonworth I teach 3rd-grade general music, direct the middle school jazz band, direct the basketball pep band, am the assistant director of the high school marching band, and integrate music throughout the district's K-6 curriculum.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

I am still in the field of education because I strongly believe we can change the world by allowing kids to experience how music can bring us together no matter who we are.

#### One day what do you hope for?

One day, I hope for a world that provides all people the opportunities and platforms to pursue their own passions in order to make our world a better place.
