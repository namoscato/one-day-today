#### What inspired you to become an educator?

I actually never thought of doing anything else. I began studying piano at age 6 and quickly decided that I would do something in the field of music.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I have taught everyone from pre-school students to seniors in high school. I have taught in public schools, private schools and I have a studio where I teach private piano lessons.

Currently, I am teaching general music in grades 1-4.

#### Why are you still in education?

I just love seeing the kiddos get excited about learning and performing. As a “specials” teacher I have seen it become more and more difficult to defend our programs and get the time we need in our subject.

#### One day what do you hope for?

I would love to see music continue in the public school setting, and it would be amazing (albeit a miracle) if we could see the kiddos more frequently than our current schedules allow.
