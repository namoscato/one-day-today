#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

I want to have a positive impact on the lives of other people. I love to help people achieve their potential. I love to share what I have with others. I love watching, playing, and teaching athletics. I also believe we are all searching for truth. I believe strongly in right and wrong. For these reasons, I believe I was created to teach. Physical education and coaching were the perfect fit. I always thought I would end up in a church somewhere, but then I met some boys on the street. They would never go to church. So, I went to the streets. On the streets, you have to build relationships, earn trust, and be very patient. I wanted to love and care for these students. My best vehicle for making a positive impact on the lives of these young people, live in their world. School is a huge part of every young person's world. If I want to make an impact, I must go to where they are. They are in school.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I have been at CVE and taught PE for 24 years. I am a teacher! I am a coach! I am a leader! I am a voice!

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

I love my job! I love Seneca Valley! I love C.V.E.! I love physical education! I love students! I love building relationships! I am still making a positive impact on the lives of others.

#### One day what do you hope for?

I hope to end my career with the same enthusiasm that I started it with. I love to meet people who have great memories of me and my class. I love to hear about my students that are doing well and being successful. I have taught long enough to have children of former students. This is a great joy to me!
