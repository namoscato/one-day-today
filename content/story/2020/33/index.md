#### What is your educational background?

I graduated from Misericordia University in May 2019. I have a dual major in early elementary education and special education.

#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

I am a teacher who stutters. I was born with my stutter and have always tried to see it as a positive aspect of my life. When I am in 'teacher mode' the stutter is not noticeable at all. Although I have students who do not notice it, I still speak about it around them, using it as a way to inspire them. I show them that I never let this unique aspect of my life stop me from accomplishing my dreams of being a teacher.

My mother inspired me to be an educator. She is someone who always believed in me. She never saw my stutter as a problem, and she found a way to make any circumstance positive. She gave me strength when I needed an extra push. Since I was young, she has always said, "Find your happy." It took me a while to figure out what exactly she meant by this, but at the age of 23, I finally understand. My mother always wanted me to embrace my differences and find my passion. Teaching and helping our future generations grow is something I have always loved doing. I want to be that strength and inspiration for my scholars and be that person that pushes them to achieve their greatest dreams in life.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

While in college, I completed my student teaching in a kindergarten class and a 4th-grade learning support class. I created and implemented a variety of differentiated lessons during these 6 months.

Currently, I am a full-time building substitute at Propel Braddock Hills Elementary School. I work with students in kindergarten to fifth grade. I am blessed Propel took a chance with me as a recent college graduate. I truly believe I made so much growth this year professionally. Being a building substitute also allowed me to build amazing relationships with students and families throughout the building.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

Teaching is something I can see myself doing forever. Some people with different careers talk about how they can't wait to retire in the future. I am young, but I cannot imagine not teaching and being in the school environment. I wake up excited to go to work and see all my kids.

I love getting to inspire my students to never give up on themselves and their dreams. I hate hearing students say "I CAN'T." It is even worse when I can visibly see that the students truly believe they can't accomplish something. I push my students to try new things and work hard to reach their goals. I find ways to help them overcome obstacles that they see as impossible. When appropriate, I use my stuttering story to give them extra motivation or inspiration.

I want to give my students a safe place that allows them to explore and learn. I want to help teach my scholars so much more than just academics. I love getting to watch them grow academically, emotionally, mentally, physically, behaviorally, and more. I want my scholars to know how much I care about them and how much I believe in them.

#### What changes can you make to shift the field towards equity and justice?

First, I love working at Propel. I feel like Propel spends a lot of time making sure they are meeting all the staff, students, and familiesâ€™ needs.

Some things I have seen in other schools that cause problems are budget cuts, no support and class size. When I can, I try to donate supplies to schools in need. A long time from now, when I am older and not teaching my own classroom, I would love to be an extra support in schools that need it.

#### One day what do you hope for?

One day, I hope "I Can" cultures are developed in all schools. I want students to believe they can accomplish any goal or dream they make for themselves. I don't want them to think any disability or difference can stop them from achieving something. Instead of saying "I can't" and stopping something, I want students to begin to say "I can't yet." This one extra word shows that they know they will be able to accomplish their goals one day. I want every student to know someone believes in them.
