#### What inspired you to become an educator?

I was inspired to become an educator by observing the roles my own family members had in the education arena when I was younger. My father was a school board director, and my mom was an elementary teacher and school guidance counselor for 43 years. Growing up I was blessed to witness first hand the time they devoted to students in the community and the connections they made with families. My father hosted gatherings at our family farm called "Fun Day" where students with Muscular Dystrophy were given the opportunity to connect with other families and have a day of fun on the farm, away from the medical realities they were facing, I saw the connections my mom made with students and families in her role at a rural elementary school. Beyond the classroom, she also changed the lives of illiterate adults by tutoring them in the evening so they could learn how to read, ultimately improving their way of life.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I was a special education teacher for 4 years, a second grader teacher for 18 years and then I landed in my current position as a Reading Specialist for 1 year. All three positions have overlapped extensively with the types of students I am fortunate to serve. In addition to being a teacher, I have valued my role through the Bully-Free Initiative at our school.

#### What grades have you taught?

As a special education teacher I worked with 3rd and 4th graders. When I was in the role of a classroom teacher I worked with second grade students. In my current role as a reading specialist, I work with kindergarten through 3rd graders.

#### Why are you still in education?

I knew from a young age that I wanted to be a teacher. The saying rings true, "Teaching isn't what you do, it is who you are!" Different from other professions... the thought of retirement actually brings a certain sense of sadness, simply because I enjoy my job that much! How blessed am I? I am thankful to be in a profession that is constantly evolving. With each change, I do my best to embrace what is new and enjoy learning and adapting. It is rewarding to me when I have had multiple siblings from the same family and have even gotten to the point where I have had the joy of having students who are children of former students. Another reward of the profession is the family unit created with my colleagues. For the most part, we support each other, encourage each other and raise our families together. Maybe that isn't the case for all schools, but I am thankful that is the case at my school.

#### One day what do you hope for?

With the changes in the world, students are exposed to such a fast pace with packed schedules. With busy days and rushed evenings, some children can easily become very anxious. My elementary school makes it a priority to address the emotional well-being of children. My hope would be that emotional wellness would be a priority for all schools and all students and that others would realize that is a vital precursor to academic achievement.
