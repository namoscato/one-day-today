#### Tell us a little bit about your educational background, hobbies, interests, etc.

I am a senior at Fox Chapel High School. I am going to be studying political science and government in college. I attended the ACLU Summer Advocacy Institute, where I was trained in effective advocacy and activism. I have worked on three local school board campaigns and was a member of GirlGov for two years. I was a fellow on Conor Lamb's 2018 congressional campaign and an intern for the Marco Attisano and Lissa Geiger Schulman PA House campaigns. Currently, I serve as head of communications and social media for the Lissa Geiger Schulman campaign. I have been a member of the O'Hara Democratic committee for two years, engaging with the issues in my community. At my High School, I am an active member of the Social Activism Club, through which I helped plan the school's March For Our Lives walkout. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels and creating art.

#### What Educational Injustices do you see inside and/or outside the walls of your own school? How can we begin to create more equitable spaces for learning?

My school district has failed to include the black narrative in our education. Black history is all but ignored and black literature is missing entirely. This is a disservice both to the students of color, unable to see themselves in their education, but also to the white students, who's euro-centric education limits their understanding of the world and of their peers. Both students and teachers have been known to make outwardly racist comments without consequence. I have witnessed many male students and teachers making sexist remarks. I often see students who come from low-income communities discriminated against, teachers and administration failing to support them. There is a very defined group of students who "just aren't college material" who are not given a chance to grow in their education.

#### What is it that you hope to do in the future? How does it relate to this important work?

In the future, I hope to get my law degree, and use my education to help protect people's civil liberties. I hope to continue to work on campaigns, but as a campaign manager or a field organizer at the federal level. My work, both on campaigns and as a lawyer, will be focused on working towards a more equitable and progressive future. I want to help create a more socially conscious world, and social consciousness starts young: in the classroom.

#### One Day...what do you hope for?

One day, I hope women/girls, people of color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and those from low income backgrounds will feel safe, supported, and seen in their education. I hope that students will leave school with a greater understanding of the world and the experiences of their peers. I hope that school administrators will listen to their students and work with them to create a better learning environment for everyone.
