#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

Looking back, I've had five great mentors in my life. But I hate to limit it to these five. I've been surrounded by bright, inquisitive, and hard-working people who have always challenged me to push myself and not create a cookie-cutter class.

Two of my mentors were my coaches in high school and college. Both of these men were great educators in their own right, inspiring diverse people from different backgrounds into teams that form the backbone of my friendships and people I look to for inspiration.

The other three were teachers – one in college and two of my coworkers – who showed me that education is NOT about the information that kids seem to think is so important to memorize. These great teachers tried to push all of their students to their best potential and install the importance of learning just to know more. I still remember the day my college Econ professor told me: "Yeah that's good, but you and I both know you can do a lot more". Begrudgingly, he was right, and that did it for me.

The other two teachers have since retired (a real loss). They were the MOST entertaining, knowledgeable, and HUMAN teachers I have ever met. They never set out to be popular, or the favorite fun teacher - they were just viewed as the BEST teachers kids had ever had. To pay it forward, for my Econ teacher's lessons I have tried my best to keep these traditions alive.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

Currently, I teach AP Human Geography, World Affairs, and Economics.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

I love the interaction with the kids. Someone has to tell them the lesson I learned: “Yeah, you're bright, but you and I both know you can do more – so amaze me!!!”

#### One day what do you hope for?

I hope that everyone will realize that teachers do not just prepare kids for their future, they are preparing the future for all of us.
