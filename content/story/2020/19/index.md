#### What is your educational background?

I received my bachelor's degree from IUP in Child Development and a minor in Educational Psychology. I then pursued my master's degree from Carlow in Early Childhood Education.

#### What or who inspired you to become an educator?

My mom was a teacher, and I always wanted to follow in her footsteps. I would often go to school with her in the summer to help pack her room up and then decorate her room for the upcoming school year. She loved teaching. It was contagious because her students loved coming to her class, and they loved learning because of her.

When I tell people who my mother is, they would often say how much they loved her as a teacher and even inspired others to become teachers because of her love for it. I now teach in the Mon Valley, as did my mother and often run into others that worked with her. I am grateful for not only having her as a mother, but for having her as my first teacher as well.

#### What roles have you had in the sphere of education?

I currently work as a pre-k teacher at Duquesne City School District. I have worked there for six years. I have worked for the AIU in Head Start and at COTRAIC as a Head Start teacher as well. I am the lead contact for our district's kindergarten transition team and am also a part of the Trying Together Fellowship.

#### Why are you still in the field of education?

I love teaching; it is natural to me. I want to make sure I can provide my students with the best start to life. When students have a solid foundation, they can build on it. When a foundation has cracks in it, it is hard to build upon. I have always thought it was so important, and I want to be the voice for the young children who don't have one yet. You can't take away education. With that being said, it is my goal to make sure my students have the best education that they can get when they are in my class, because that is something you can't take away from them.

#### One day what do you hope for?

I hope that one day, all students will be able to have a solid foundation to their education. I hope that pre-k becomes universal so we can close the educational gaps early instead of trying to fix them later on in a child's life. Ages 0-5 are the most crucial time in life, and we need to make sure all students have that solid foundation!
