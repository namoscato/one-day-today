#### Book Synopsis

Love is action.

On a beautiful mural in the school yard, talking fingerprints come to life as they realize their colors are being mislabeled by humanity. Biases are thrown aside as the colors begin to work to redefine their mural in a colorblind society as blue redefines itself as fury instead of sadness and red as calmness instead of anger and yellow as sorrow instead of joy.

Eventually, a child points out that no one has talked about the misrepresentations of black and white. Black is mislabeled as darkness and despair while white is mislabeled as peace and purity. White is good. Black is bad. Only with the help of the other fingerprints does White begin to realize the problem with always starting the “mural” with white as the base color. The original mural is eradicated as the prints begin to completely change the system on which the mural is built.

Color Theory is just one of the many facets of systemic racism. How we teach colors to children and how we attach moods and emotions to those colors needs to change. Thus, we all must have a hand in the creation of a better mural threaded with understanding and most importantly-love.
